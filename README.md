Game Player - by Tobias Fischer

What is this? Game player is a Qt application to let you and ceretain engines play various games. The current supported games are Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4.

Why? Game player was made as a personal project to familiarize myself better with c++ and learn how certain things are implemented in this language (like polymorphism). I also had the goal of trying to remove as much duplicate code and extrapolated everything to be passed through with inheritance.
